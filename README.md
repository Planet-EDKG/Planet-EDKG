## About Me

- Informatics master's student (yes, voluntarily)
- Research assistant (HiWi), because two jobs are better than one
- Based in Görlitz, Germany – no, not the Netflix version
- Specialized in Python (mainly Flask), Docker, Git, and sarcastic logging statements

## Currently working on

- Writing code that works in dev and breaks in prod
- Debugging issues that I introduced three weeks ago and promptly forgot
- Pretending to understand async

## Tech Stack

```text
Languages:      Python, but understanding more ;)
Frameworks:     Flask
Tools:          Docker, Git, Linux, VS Code
Version Ctrl:   Git (because you have to)
```

## Fun Fact

I once wrote 300 lines of Flask code to avoid writing a 3-line shell script.  
It worked. Nobody’s proud of it, but it worked.
